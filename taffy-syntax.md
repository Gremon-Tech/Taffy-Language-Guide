Now,let's look at the syntax of the Taffy programming language.

## Keywords

### print

"print" --Print the characters, numbers, and symbols that you type.


This keyword syntax is print \[You enter the character\(function value\)\]

Please pay attention to the following three points:


a."You enter the character" can contain the ASCII escape character, such as \n,\r.

b."Function value"must be declared function.


c."You enter the character" can have "function definition characters", but it must be used with "function value".
